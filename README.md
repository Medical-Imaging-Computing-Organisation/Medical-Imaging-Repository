# Medical Imaging Computing Upcoming Goals:


## Image Reconstruction:

#### Create the Direct Back Projection Algorithm:

- Write code for extracting energies, times and channel number from a CSV-style data set provided by Labs (I was told it would be semi-colon delimited today). We will need to be provided with which channel was plugged into which detector and where those detectors were during the measurement window. May need to change coordinate system.
- Write code for identifying which events are coincident and correspond to a compton scatter followed by photoelectric absorption. Discard other events.
- Write code (maths) for generating angles and hence cones using the selected events.
- Write code for generating a heatmap of cone overlaps and plot it, resulting in the image.

## Image Reconstruction Roles:

- Extract data into usable format from labs: Chris

- Identify Coincidences: Alfie

- Generate Cones (DBP): Richard

- Create Heatmap: Adam


## Monte Carlo:

#### Start learning Geant4:
- Attend Tony's lesson on Tuesday 16/1/24
- Familiarise with C++ and Geant4 (More details can be added once the task is started and better understood)

#### Physics, Equations, Identifying Parameters and Assumptions:
- Learn the relevant physics and equations required for possible events within the detectors, in preparation for predictive modelling.
