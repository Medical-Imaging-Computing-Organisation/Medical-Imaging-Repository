This is the document that outlines how to implement changes and restore oldest working versions of code. 

We should be editing our code using the Bear browser. The URL link is provided in the Linux Commands file. We use the browser link as it makes
saving directly to the Compton/main2024/ComptonExample directory and checking compilation and output very easy. 

An original 'clean' version of the code that Tony wrote is still available outside the Compton/main2024 for emergencies. 

The problem lies in that if you save faulty code to the server, then no one else can compile the code to check for their errors.
